1. **Daily 1-1.5 hours weekdays; longer sessions on weekends.**
2. **Spaced repetition:** highlight key points, review weekly.
3. **Practical projects:**
   - For AI books: build 1-2 real projects (finance AI/ML models).
   - For trading: apply strategies via paper trading.
   - For business/philosophy: write short summaries, apply insights to career development.
